<h3>2. Installation </h3>

<ul>

<h2>Integration of the SpongeStats module in the pages with auditer </h2>
<p>SpongeStats makes use of the file stats.php to enter information of statistics in the database. You will  make a connection between your pages PHP and this script by adding the following code in your pages PHP.</p>
<pre><strong>&lt;?php include_once(&quot;spongestats/stats.php&quot;); ?&gt;</strong></pre>
<p>This instruction will make it possible to insert the file <strong>stats.php</strong> of the /<strong>spongestats</strong> directory. </p>

<p><strong>Caution: </strong>The function include () PHP interprets the ways in same way  as if you thus established a link HTML it is necessary well to think of the way towards the file. For example if the file that you wish to add to the statistics is in the /blog/ directory with the root of your Web site and which you copied the directory spongestats with the root also, it will be necessary for you to use the following instruction in the place :</p>

<pre><strong>&lt;?php include(&quot;../spongestats/stats.php&quot;); ?</strong>&gt;</pre>
